Compile lab


- compile lab 1: translate .c to .asm
- compile lab 2: require lexer analyze
- compile lab 3: `require syntax analyze?` Actually add function define and call on the basis of lab 2
- compile lab 4: Add control and condition sentence (while, if-else, break, continue)

*summary*:
The code is awful... but AC. Many functions are not named well and may be abstract to a class. Reload functions only used one type (because I found the input args may make it easier by using anthor way like iter rather than vector... but they can convert easily though.ðŸ˜†)
The most difficult lab may be lab3? I'v forgotten the lab1 and lab2. I modify README after I finished lab4 and lab4 is a little increment on lab3. Be careful about the label name !!!
